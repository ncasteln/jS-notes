# losing-this

This small example shows the "losing this" problem and its possible solution.

# this
_this_ in JavaScript is dynamical and unbound; instead for example of C++ in which this is always referring to the instance in whch it is deferenced, in JavaScript it is evaluated runtime. The most often scenario is about using callback functions, but it can appear also in other cases.
